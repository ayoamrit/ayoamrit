## I'm Amrit Dhaliwal!
> "Anyone who keeps learning stays young." - Henry Ford

I would like to pursue the career of being a professional software or game developer in Java/C++ becuase I love coding in those two languages and I have done a bit in Python as well. As a thinking introvert, I enjoy reading philosophy, poetry, and pre-literary history.  

- *Currently:* Computer Information Systems Student at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.

## Experience
- *Recently:* Apart from my school projects, I developed a software for [Fleetwood Immigration Company](http://www.fleetwoodimmigration.com/) in Tkinter, standard GUI library for Python.
